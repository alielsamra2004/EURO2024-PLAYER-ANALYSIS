# EURO 2024 Player Analysis

A data-driven project that analyzes and ranks players in EURO 2024 using advanced performance metrics. This model compares player performance through statistical modeling and matches the findings with public opinion to highlight alignment—or discrepancies—between analytics and perception.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Scrape or import player performance data from EURO 2024.
- Normalize and engineer features to evaluate overall impact.
- Build a Player Score Index (PSI) that ranks players based on multiple advanced metrics.
- Compare the top-rated players from the model with popular/public opinion rankings.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📈 Advanced metric-based player ranking system
- ⚽ Position-aware performance modeling
- 🧠 Data preprocessing with normalization and feature engineering
- 🤖 Player Score Index (PSI) computation using weighted metrics
- 🧪 Public vs. model-based player comparison
- 📊 Visualizations of top players, scores, and comparisons

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
-
